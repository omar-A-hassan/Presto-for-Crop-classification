# PRESTO Crop Classification System

## Overview

This project implements a satellite-based crop classification system using the PRESTO foundation model for agricultural monitoring. The system classifies three crop types (cacao, oil palm, rubber) using Sentinel-2 satellite time series data extracted via Google Earth Engine.

## Approach and Method

### Foundation Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: PRESTO (Pre-trained satellite transformer) from the original research implementation
- **Fine-tuning Strategy**: Two-stage approach with frozen backbone followed by selective unfreezing
- **Input Processing**: Variable-length time series (up to 24 months) with 14 spectral and vegetation features
- **Classification Head**: Multi-layer architecture with batch normalization and dropout regularization

### Training Strategy
The model employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach:

**Stage 1: Classification Head Training (10-15 epochs)**
- PRESTO backbone frozen to preserve pre-trained features
- Only classification head trainable (learning rate: 1e-3)
- Focus on learning crop-specific classification patterns

**Stage 2: Selective Fine-tuning (5-10 epochs)**  
- Unfreeze last 2-3 transformer layers
- Lower learning rate (1e-5) for careful adaptation
- Fine-tune high-level features while preserving foundation model knowledge

### Dataset and Data Processing
- **Total Samples**: 3,764 coordinate-based samples across 4 geographic regions
- **Cacao**: 342 samples (Peru Amazon: 209, Ghana West Africa: 133)
- **Oil Palm**: 1,288 samples (Peru Ucayali region)
- **Rubber**: 2,134 samples (China Xishuangbanna region)
- **Satellite Data**: Sentinel-2 time series (2020-2021) with 10m spatial resolution
- **Features**: 10 spectral bands plus 4 vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NDWI, RNDVI)

### Validation Methodology
- **Geographic Stratification**: Ensures no spatial overlap between training and validation sets
- **5-Fold Cross-Validation**: Balanced across crop types and geographic regions
- **Holdout Test Set**: Independent evaluation dataset never used during training or hyperparameter optimization

## Critical Challenge: Domain Shift Issue

The system faces a fundamental domain shift problem between training and test data:

**Training Data Characteristics:**
- Source: Active crop areas with healthy vegetation
- NDVI values: ~0.477 (indicating robust vegetation)
- Data quality: High-quality satellite observations from known crop locations

**Test Data Characteristics:**
- Source: Unknown geographic/temporal conditions
- NDVI values: ~0.015 (indicating severely degraded or absent vegetation)
- Domain gap: 0.406 NDVI difference from training data

**Impact on Performance:**
The model achieves 99.87% accuracy on training data with balanced performance across all classes. However, when applied to test data with universally low vegetation indices, it consistently predicts cacao (which had the lowest NDVI in training data). This demonstrates the model is functioning correctly according to learned patterns, but the test domain represents fundamentally different land conditions than the training domain.

## Configuration

The system uses environment variables for sensitive configuration:

```bash
# Google Earth Engine authentication
export GEE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
export GEE_PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
export GEE_KEY_FILE="path/to/service-account-key.json"
```

Configuration files use relative paths and are located in `src/utils/config.py` with fallback defaults for all settings.
